## Why Air Aware Labs?

We make air pollution visible - we link it to you and your health and enable you to make healthier choices

# Our vision

Our vision is a world where everyone can access clean air. Where knowledge of exposure leads to better health for everyone. Where the invisible becomes visible

## Optimise your activity

At Air Aware Labs we want to bring health benefits to everyone. We've launched our first product - AirTrack - designed for people exercising outdoors, as we take on the most air when our lungs are working hardest. What's more, athletes' performance is directly affected when air pollution is higher.

AirTrack helps you to understand and reduce your exposure to air pollution. Join hundreds of other users who receive air quality updates direct to their Strava feed and in their personalised dashboard. We work with elite athletes to determine what will support you best.
